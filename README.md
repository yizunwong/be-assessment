Interns will come up with a simple test for the week to understand Next.js better. 

# Assessment Task: Next.js, MongoDB, and NextAuth.js Blog Application

# Goal:
Create a blog application using Next.js for the frontend, MongoDB for data storage, and implement user authentication using NextAuth.js. Deploy the application on Vercel.

Additional Requirements:
# Authentication:
Implement user authentication using NextAuth.js.
Allow users to sign up, log in, and log out.
Ensure that only authenticated users can create new blog posts.
Display the author's name for each blog post based on the authenticated user.
Proper integration of NextAuth.js for user authentication.
Implementation of secure authentication flows (sign up, log in, log out).
Restriction of blog post creation to authenticated users.

# Frontend:
Update the frontend to include user authentication features.
Display a login/logout button on the homepage based on the user's authentication status.
Only show the "Create a new post" button if the user is authenticated.
User interface updates to reflect the authentication status (login/logout buttons, visibility of certain features).
Clear indication of the blog post author based on the authenticated user.

# Documentation:
Include instructions on setting up and configuring NextAuth.js for authentication.
Explain how the authentication flow works within the application.
Document any changes made to the frontend due to authentication.
Clear documentation of how to use the authentication features.
Explanation of any changes made to the frontend due to authentication.

# Deployment:
Update the deployment process to handle authentication-related configurations.
Ensure that the deployed application works seamlessly with authentication on Vercel.
Evaluation Criteria (in addition to previous criteria):

# Submission:
The intern should provide an updated GitHub repository containing the Next.js project, associated documentation (including updates for authentication), and share the deployed application link on Vercel.

# Presentation
The intern will be presenting to the tech team on their deliverables on how they set up the application.
